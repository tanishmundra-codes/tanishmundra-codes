### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>
 

I'm Tanish, a full-stack developer based in India.

I love turning ideas into lightning-fast, accessible interfaces that feel effortless.

Outside of coding, you'll find me playing video games, badminton, or hitting the gym. I also yap on Twitter sharing tech related content and documenting my journey.

#### Fun Fact:

I like to code with a cup of tea. üçµ
